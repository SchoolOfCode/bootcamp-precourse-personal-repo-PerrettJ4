# Precourse Personal Repo

I chose this tribute because I thought ducks are awesome. They have really cool swimming techniques and seem very chill 1005% of the time. As the **ex-primeduckster** Lezley Ducksworth one said: 
> "True nobility is proven via the donning of a well fitted hat, and only then may a duck wet its' beak."

Wise words, wise words indeed, which continue to be echoed today via Gerald's awesome fashion sense. No wonder he can make friends with _alligators_!

##### I have kept the following content for myself: 
- Add, commit, and push your changes to that repository using your new Git skills on the command line in the VS Code terminal.
- You can then go in and make the repository public in the settings if you'd like so that it shows up on your GitHub profile for the world to see.
- This way, you'll embed your skills and have your first project in your portfolio, and we'll be able to check out your code and be able to give you feedback as well.
